# Plan

1. Create all pages with all different components and styling without user interactions and API integration and take into consideration the whole design file: fonts, spacing, colors, hover effects...
1. Turn every finished component (header, hero section, main content, footer,...) responsive on the fly.
1. Integrate the joke API and make the website dynamic (with user interactions).
